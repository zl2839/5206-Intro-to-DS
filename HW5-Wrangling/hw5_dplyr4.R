# HW5: Data manipulation
#'
# 1. Load the `tidyr` and `dplyr` package and use `data` to read in the `billboard` data which describes
#    Song rankings for billboard top 100 in the year 2000.
#    Now let's start analyze the dataset!
#    For the following exercises, use the pipe operator `%>%` as much as you can.

data = billboard
# 2. Let's take a look at the `billboard` data, we notice that there're 79 columns in total
#    and 76 columns to represent the rankings of each week.
#    Put the week name into one column called `week` and store the ranking
#    into another column called `rank`, keep the first three column names, save the new tibble
#    dataframe into `t1`, which will have 24,092 rows and 5 columns.
#    Hint: you can use `pivot_longer` and `starts_with`.
#    To check your solution, it should print to:
#    # A tibble: 24,092 x 5

# 3. We can notice that in `t1`,
#    1. The rank includes a lot of `NA` values,
#    2. The `wk` in front of each `week` is redundant.
#    So now do the same thing as the previous question, but this time drop the `NA` values and
#    change `wk<number>` to `<number>` for the `week` column as well.
#    Hint: to do so, you can start from `billboard` dataset and use `pivot_longer` along with the
#    `names_prefix` and `values_drop_na` arguments.
#    Save your result into `t2`.
#    Your new `t2` should have 5307 rows and 5 columns.

# 4. Now we want to check the highest rank increase within one week.
#    For example for the first track `Baby Don't Cry (Keep...`, its weekly ranking is
#    87, 82, 72, 77, 87, 94, 99, so the highest rank increase will be 82-72=10 from week2 to week3.
#    For each track, compute its highest rank increase, save the answer in the column `highest_rank_increase`.
#    To do that, you can use:
#    - `mutate` and `lag` to calculate the rank difference.
#    - `filter` to filter out the information for week 1
#    (because week 1 is the first week for which the song has a rank thus there is no rank increase).
#    - `summarize`and `group_by` to find out the maximum of rank difference.
#    Save your answer into `t2_rank`, which should include 313 rows and 4 columns:
#    `artist`, `track`, `date.entered` and `highest_rank_increase`.
#    To check your solution, it should print to:
