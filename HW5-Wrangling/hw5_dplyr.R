# 2. Extract a tibble `length_sex_ring` of dimension 1216 x 4

#    The dataset should be filtered for length strictly larger than 0.6 and
#    be sorted by increasing `sex` and decreasing `ring`.
#    To do that, you can use:
#      - `filter` to select rows that have `length` larger than 0.6.
#      - `arrange` to arrange data set by sex with first `"F"` then `"I"` and `"M"`,
#      and descending order of `ring`.
#      - `select` to select columns `sex`, `diameter`, `height` and `rings`.

#    The dataset should be grouped by increasing `sex` and summarized by
#    finding mean, max and min of `shucked_weight`.
#    To do that, you can use
#      - `group_by` to group data set by `sex` with first `"F"` then `"I"` and `"M"`.
#      - `summarize` to to collapse all values into three new columns:
#      `weight_mean`, `weight_max` and `weight_min`.

#    You should also rearrange `index`, `sex`, `length`, `diameter` and `rings`.

#    To do that, you can use

# 6. Extract a tibble `transmute` of dimension 4177 x 2,
