# HW5: tidyr2
#'
#    In this exercise, you will familiarize yourself with the procedure of
#    tidying up data.
#    Throughout the exercise, use `%>%` to structure your operations.
#    Do NOT use `for`, `while` or `repeat` loops.
#'
# 1. Load the package `readr` and use its function `read_csv()` to read the
#    dataset `activities.csv` (located in directory `data/`). Store the
#    corresponding dataframe into a tibble `activities`.
#    In this dataset, each record is an observation (keyed by `id` and `trt`,
#    i.e., treatment group) whose score has been recorded at two times (`T1` and
#    `T2`) for three actions (`work`, `play` and `talk`).
## Do not modify this line!

library(readr)
activities = read_csv('data/activities.csv')

# 2. Recall the three rules for a tidy dataset. What is the issue here?
#    We have variables stored in multiple columns!
#    Load the packages `tidyr` and `dplyr`.
#    From the `activities` tibble, extract a tibble `act_gathered` of
#    dimension 60 x 4 that contains the `id`, `trt`, `var` and `score` columns.
#    `var` is a new column that collects the six columns for `work`, `play` and
#    `talk`, while `score` is the corresponding score. The dataset should be
#    sorted by increasing `id` and `trt`.
#    To do this, you can use:
#    (1) `gather()` to collect the six columns for `var`.
#    (2) `arrange()` to sort the result by ascending order of `id` and `trt`.
#    Alternatively, you can use `pivot_longer()`.
#    To check your solution, `act_gathered` prints to:
#    # A tibble: 60 x 4
#          id trt   var      score
#       <int> <chr> <chr>    <dbl>
#     1     1 cnt   work.T1 0.652
#     2     1 cnt   play.T1 0.865
#     3     1 cnt   talk.T1 0.536
#     4     1 cnt   work.T2 0.275
#     5     1 cnt   play.T2 0.354
#     6     1 cnt   talk.T2 0.0319
#     7     2 cnt   work.T1 0.568
#     8     2 cnt   play.T1 0.615
#     9     2 cnt   talk.T1 0.0931
#    10     2 cnt   work.T2 0.229
#    # … with 50 more rows

library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
act_gathered = activities %>% 
  gather('work.T1','play.T1','talk.T1','work.T2','play.T2','talk.T2', 
         key = 'var',value = 'score')%>%
  arrange(id,trt)

# 3. What is the issue now? Two variables are stored in a single column!
#    From `act_gathered`, extract a tibble `act_separated` of dimension 60 x 5
#    that contains the `id`, `trt`, `action`, `time` and `score` columns.
#    `action` and `time` are two new columns that are separated from
#    `act_gathered$var`.
#    To do this, you can use `separate()` to separate `var` in `act_gathered`.
#    To check your solution, `act_separated` prints to:
#    # A tibble: 60 x 5
#          id trt   action time   score
#       <int> <chr> <chr>  <chr>  <dbl>
#     1     1 cnt   work   T1    0.652
#     2     1 cnt   play   T1    0.865
#     3     1 cnt   talk   T1    0.536
#     4     1 cnt   work   T2    0.275
#     5     1 cnt   play   T2    0.354
#     6     1 cnt   talk   T2    0.0319
#     7     2 cnt   work   T1    0.568
#     8     2 cnt   play   T1    0.615
#     9     2 cnt   talk   T1    0.0931
#    10     2 cnt   work   T2    0.229
#    # … with 50 more rows
## Do not modify this line!
act_separated = act_gathered %>% 
  separate(var, into = c('action', 'time'))


# 4. Is this dataset finally tidy? Not quite, we still have observations
#    stored in multiple rows.
#    From `act_separated`, extract a tibble `act_spread` of dimension 20 x 6
#    that contains the `id`, `trt`, `time`, `play`, `talk` and `work` columns.
#    `play`, `talk` and `work` are three new columns that are spread from
#    `act_separated$action`.
#    To do this, you can use `spread()` to spread `action` in `act_separated`.
#    Alternatively, you can use `pivot_wider()`.
#    To check your solution, `act_spread` (using `spread()`) prints to:
#    # A tibble: 20 x 6
#      id trt   time   play   talk    work
#       <int> <chr> <chr> <dbl>  <dbl>   <dbl>

# 5. There is one missing value in `act_spread`. Use the function `is.na` and
