# HW5: more data manipulation

# For this exercise, we will explore NYC airbnb dataset.

# 1. Load the `data/Airbnb_NYC_2019.csv` dataset and assign it to a tibble `airbnb`.
#    To check your result, `airbnb` prints to:

# 2. We want to find the most expensive neighbourhood of NYC. So we need to get
#    a report containing the following information:
#    (`neighbourhood`, `avg_price`, `price_rank`)
#    where `avg_price` is the average price of the apartments in that neighbourhood,
#    `price_rank` is the quantile of the average price of that neighbourhood, among
#    all neighbourhoods. E.g., if a neighbourhood is the second most expensive of 5
#    neighbourhoods, its percent rank will be 0.75.
#    To do that, you can use:
#        - `drop_na()` to remove the NAs,
#        - `group_by()` to group the apts by neighourhood,
#        - `summarise()` to calculate the average price of each neighbourhood.
#        - `mutate()` and `percent_rank()` to calculate the quantile of
#          each neighbourhood saved in column `price_rank`.
#    Save the result data frame to `nyc_price`.
#    To check your result, `nyc_price` prints to:
#    # A tibble: 218 x 3
#    neighbourhood              avg_price price_rank
#    <chr>                          <dbl>      <dbl>

#    9 Bay Terrace                    119.      0.668
#    10 Bay Terrace, Staten Island     102.      0.562

# 3. Using `nyc_price`:
#    Find the top 10% most expensive neighbourhoods and
#    report them in alphabetical order.
#    Save the result tibble to `nyc_10percent`.
#    To do that, you can use:
#         - `filter()` function to filter the `price_rank`.
#         - `arrange()` to reorder the neighbourhoods.
#    To check your result, `nyc_10percent` prints to :

# 4. Calculate the median price and median availability days of each room type.
#    Save the result tibble into `by_type`.
#    To do that, you can use:
#       - `group_by()` and `select()` to group the apartments and select columns.
#       - `summarize()` to calculate the median of each group.
#    To check your result, `by_type` prints to:

# 5. We want to know the room tyoes count and proportion in different neighbourhoods.
#    We need a report contanining the following information:
#    (neighbourhood, count, prop)
#    where `prop` is the proportion of each room type among all the rooms in that neighbourhood
#    and `count` is the total number of each room type in that neighbourhood.
#    Save the result tibble into `neighbourhood_room`.
#    To do that, you can use:
#       - `group_by()` to group the apartments.
#       - `count()` to count the number of apartments in each group.
#       - `sum()` to sum the number of apartments in each group.
#       - `mutate()` to calculate the proportion and add new columnn `prop`.
#    To check your result, `neighbourhood_room` prints to:

# 6. We want to convert the above tibble to a different form, showing in three separate
#    columns the proportion of each room type within each neighbourhood.
#    Save the result tibble into `neighbourhood_room_wider`.
#    To do that, you can use:
