# HW5: football result dataset
# In this problem, we will deal with a dataset of national football game results from
# 1870s to now. You are not allowed to use loops `for`, `while`, and functions `sort`
# or `repeat` in this exercise.
#'
# 1. Load the file `data/football.csv` and save it into tibble `fu`.
#    It should have dimensions: `40,945 x 9` and looks like the following:
#    # A tibble: 40,945 x 9
#    date       home_team away_team home_score away_score tournament city    country  neutral
#    <date>     <chr>     <chr>          <dbl>      <dbl> <chr>      <chr>   <chr>    <lgl>

#  2. Sometimes, we want to know the year of a game happening instead of
#    the exact dates. So now we want to split the dates into three columns:
#    (`year`, `mon`, `day`) and save the result tibble to `fu_separated`.
#    To do that, you can use:
#       - `separate` to separate the first column `date`
#    (Hint : Use `sep = "[-]+"` in `separate`.)
#    To check your solution, `fu_separated` prints to:
#    # A tibble: 40,945 x 11
#    year  mon   day   home_team away_team home_score away_score tournament city    country  neutral

# 3. Notice that the data is recorded per game instead of per team. But we also want
#    to have a list to record the game data per team with the following information:
#    `year`, `mon`, `day`, `home_score`, `away_score`, `tournament`, `city`, `country`,
#    `neutral`, `team_type`, `team`.
#    To do that, we need to list all the games each team played.
#    (so the same game will be recorded twice, one for home team and one for away team)
#    To do that, you can use:
#         - `pivot_longer to transform the `home_team` and `away_team` columns to
#          new columns `team` and `team_type` recording whether this team is `home_team`
#          or `away_team` in this game.
#    and save the result tibble into the tibble `fu_tidy`.
#    (Note: to use the correct version of `select`, write `select <- dplyr::select` beforehand).
#    To check your solution, `fu_tidy` prints to:
#    # A tibble: 81,890 x 11

# 4. Now the two columns `home_score` and `away_score` are redundant for each team.
#    We just want the score of the team, not the scores of the two teams.
#    Namely, we want a tibble with the following information:
#    `year`, `mon`, `day`, `tournament`, `city`, `country`, `neutral`, `team`, `score`
#    To do that, you can use:
#         - `mutate` and `if_else` to record the `score` of that team
#         - `select` to extract all columns except `(team_type, home_score, away_score)`
#    Save the resulting tibble into `fu_team`.
#    To check your solution, `fu_team` prints to:
#    # A tibble: 81,890 x 9

# 5. The `city` and `country` column represents where the game was held.
#    We want to concatenate the city and country information into one column
#    called `place` based on our team table `fu_team`.
#    To do that, you can use:
