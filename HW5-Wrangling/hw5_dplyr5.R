# HW5: Data Manipulation on CitiBike data
#'
# Refrain from using any loops (`for`, `while`) and `repeat` for this exercise.
#'
# 1. Load the packages `readr`.
# Use `read_csv()` to create a `tibble` from the
# csv file `/course/data/citybike.csv` taken from sampled data
# from [Citibike usage data](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data) and
# assign it to variable `trips`. The file contains data corresponding to
# every bike trip taken by users in August 2016.
# Peek at the first rows of `trips` using `head()` to get a feel of
# what your data is like and assign the result to tibble `head_trips`.
# Looking up `head_trips` will now give a quick overview of the dataset.
# (dimensions should be `trips (100,000x15)`, `head_trips (6x15)`)
#'

library(readr)
trips = read_csv('data/citibike.csv')
head_trips = head(trips,6)

# 2. Load the `stringr` package. Use `names` and `str_replace_all` to replace
# the spaces in column names with underscores `_`. This will make it easier to
# manipulate those columns. Do not change the order of columns when doing so.
#'
## Do not modify this line!
library(stringr)
names(trips) =names(trips) %>% str_replace_all(' ','_')


# 3. Load the package `dplyr`.
# Find the largest and smallest birth year of people that took trips in August
# 2016. Assign the result to a tibble `years` with only two columns
# `min_birth_year` and `max_birth_year` (in this order), and only one row.
# You can use:
#   - `summarize()`, `min()` and `max()` - make sure you use the
#   `na.rm` argument of `min()` and `max()` wisely.
# (dimensions should be `years (1x2)`)
# To check your solution, `years` prints to:
# # A tibble: 1 x 2
# min_birth_year max_birth_year
# <dbl>          <dbl>
# 1           1885           2000
#'

years = trips %>% 
  summarize(min_birth_year = min(birth_year,na.rm = T), 
            max_birth_year = max(birth_year,na.rm = T))


# 4. Find all trips that started and ended on Broadway. Assign the result to
# tibble `broadway`. `broadway` should be similar to `trips`, but only contain
# the trips that started and ended on Broadway.
# You can use:
#   - `filter()` and `str_detect()` (and `|` in the `str_detect()` call).
# (dimensions should be `broadway (18,603x15)`)
# To check your solution, `broadway` prints to:
# # A tibble: 18,603 x 15

# 5. Create a `trips_counts` tibble that contains the counts of each
# possible trip (one possible trip = one starting station and one ending

# 6. Create a tibble `frequent_trips` containing the 10 most frequent
# station-to-station trips (it should contain three columns -
# `start_station_name`, `end_station_name` and `count` (in this order)).
# To do so you can:
#  - start with `trips_counts`,
#  - re-order it in descending order of `count` (using `arrange()`
#  and `desc()`),
#  - use `head()` to retain only the 10 first elements.
# (dimensions should be `frequent_trips (10x3)`)
# To check your solution, the first three lines of  `frequent_trips` print to:
