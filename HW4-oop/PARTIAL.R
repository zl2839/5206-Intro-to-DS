# by combining the `sqrt` and `mean` functions.
# Note: Use compose directly to create `mean_sqrt_fun`, so that its arguments are the same 
#       as the arguments of `mean`.
# Then, use `map_dbl` to apply `mean_sqrt_fun` to each column of `airquality` and assign
# the result to a vector named `mean_sqrt_na`.
# Notice that one could use `mean_sqrt_fun(x, na.rm = TRUE)` to take care of the
# `NA` that appear for the mean of some columns, but you don't need to do it here.
