# HW3: Function composition
#'
# An important way of combining functions is through composition: `f(g(x))`. Composition takes a list of functions
# and applies them sequentially to the input.
#'
# We will work with the Iris dataset. The Iris dataset contains the results of multiple measurements on Iris
# flowers used to quantify the morphologic variation of Iris flowers of three related species. The dataset consists
# of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris Setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor). Four
# features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters. This
# dataset became a typical test case for many statistical classification techniques in machine learning.
#'
# 1. Load the `purrr` package and the `tibble` package. Load the Iris dataset into the namespace using `data(iris)`.
# This essentially loads the variable `iris` as a data frame containing the iris data.  Turn it into a tibble using
# `as_tibble`.
# Note: the tibble should be named `iris`.

library(purrr)
library(tibble)
iris = as_tibble(iris)
iris

# 2. Use `map_dbl` and `compose` from the `purrr` package to return the square root of the number of unique values in
# each column of the `iris` tibble. Assign the result to a variable `squ_n_unique`. Use the built-in `sqrt`,
# `length` and `unique` functions.

n_unique = map_dbl(map(iris,unique), length)
squ_n_unique = compose(sqrt)(n_unique)
squ_n_unique
squ_n_unique = map_dbl(iris,compose(sqrt,length,unique))
squ_n_unique
# 3. Now build your own custom `compose_2` function operator that takes in two inputs `f` and `g` and returns
# the function `f(g(...))`
# Note: we assume that the input/output of `f` and `g` match such that the composition makes sense. Make
# sure you use `force()`. You are not allowed to use `compose` from the `purrr` package here.
## Do not modify this line!

compose_2 <- function(f, g) {
  force(f)
  force(g)
  function(...) f(g(...))
}
compose_2(sqrt, sqrt)(16)
# 4. Use `compose_2` to build your own custom `compose_3` function operator that takes in three input
# functions `f`, `g` and `h` of functions and returns the composition of those (a function itself).
# Note: Use only one call to `compose_2` to do so. Again, we assume that the input/output of the functions match
# such that the composition makes sense. Make sure you use `force()`. You are not allowed to use `compose` from the
# `purrr` package here.
## Do not modify this line!

compose_3 = function(f,g,h){
  force(f)
  force(g)
  force(h)
  r = compose_2(g,h)
  function(...) f(r(...))
}
compose_3(sqrt,sqrt,sqrt)(16)

# 5. Use `custom_3` and `map_dbl` to replicate the results you obtained using `purrr::compose` in question 2. Assign the result to a
# variable `squ_n_unique_custom`.
# Hint: again, use the built-in `sqrt`, `length` and `unique` functions.
#'

squ_n_unique_custom= map_dbl(iris,compose_3(sqrt,length,unique))
