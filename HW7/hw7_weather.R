# HW7: Strings and Dates
#'
# In this exercise, you will manipulate a dataset with strings and factors.
#'
# Throughout the exercise:
#    - Use `theme_light()` for the plots.
#    - Do not change the default position of the plot title.
#    - Do not print the plot.
#'
# In this exercise, you have to recreate the figures found at
# the left of the instructions.
# We suggest functions you can use to create the plots, but
# you are free to use the method you are the most comfortable with.
# Make sure that the figures look exactly like the ones you are supposed to create.
#'
# 1. Load the `tidyverse`, `rattle`,  `ggplot2` and `lubridate` packages.
#    Use `data(weather)` to read the dataset `weather` from the
#    `rattle` package.
#    Store it in a tibble `weather` using `as_tibble()`.

# 2. Create two tibbles `weather_9am` and `weather_3pm`.
#    `weather_9am` should contain all the variables which names end with
#    `"9am"` and the column `Date`. `"9am"` should be removed from the
#    names of its variables and the format of `Date`` should be changed as follow :
#    Instead of `"Y-M-D"`, add `"Y-M-D h:m:s AECT"` where `"AECT"` is the time zone
#    code for Australian Eastern Time and `h:m:s` is `09:00:00` (9 am).
#    For example, the Date column first value will be `"2007-11-01 09:00:00 AEDT"`.
#    `weather_3pm` should contain all the variables which names end with
#    `"3pm"` and the column `Date`. `"3pm"` should be removed from the
#    names of its variables and the format of `Date`` should be changed as follow :
#    Instead of `"Y-M-D"`, add `"Y-M-D h:m:s AECT"` where `"AECT"` is the time zone
#    code for Australian Eastern Time and `h:m:s` is `15:00:00` (3 pm).
#    For example, the Date column first value will be `"2007-11-01 15:00:00 AEDT"`.
#    To do so, you can use :
#       - `select()` and `ends_with()` to select the right columns
#       - `rename_all()` and `str_remove()` to rename the columns correctly
#       - `mutate()`, `ymd_hms()` and `paste()` to change the format of `Date`
#         Hint : If you use  `ymd_hms()`, set `tz` to `"Australia/Canberra"`
#    `weather_9am` should print to :
