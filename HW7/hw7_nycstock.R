# HW7: NYC stock analysis
#'
# In this exercise, you will conduct complete data analysis on NYC stock price.
#'
# Dataset consists of following files:
# `prices.csv`: raw, as-is daily prices. Most of data spans from 2010 to the end 2016,
#             for companies new on stock market date range is shorter.
#             There have been approximmately 140 stock splits in that time,
#             this set doesn't account for that.
# `securities.csv`: general description of each company with division on sectors
# `fundamentals.csv`: metrics extracted from annual SEC 10K fillings (2012-2016),
#              should be enough to derive most of popular fundamental indicators.
#'
# 1. Do the following:
#      - load the `readr`, `dplyr` and `tidyr` package
#      - load `/course/data/prices.csv` using `read_csv()` and save it to `raw`.
#      - load `data/securities.csv` using `read_csv()` and save it to `sectors`.
#      - load `data/fundamentals.csv` using `read_csv()` and save it to `fund`.
#    `raw` should look like:
#    # A tibble: 851,264 x 7

# 2. Load the `stringr` and `lubridate` packages.
#    Currently, the date in `raw` are in `UTC` time. We want to convert them
#    to New York time zone.
#    To do so, you can:
#      - use `mutate()` to convert the date column
#      - use `force_tz()` to format the date, with argument
#      ` tz` set to `America/New_York`.
#  Save the generated tibble into `raw_time`.
#  `raw_time$date` should be in this format:
#  [1] "2016-01-05 EST" "2016-01-06 EST" "2016-01-07 EST" "2016-01-08 EST"..
#  [6] "2016-01-12 EST" "2016-01-13 EST" "2016-01-14 EST" "2016-01-15 EST"..

raw_time = raw %>% mutate(date = force_tz(date,tz = 'America/New_York'))




# 3. Load the package `forcats`.
#    In `securities`, keep the companies belonging to the top 6 sectors
#    (by frequency of occurence), as well as those whose `GICS Sub Industry`
#    falls into `"Gold"` or `"Real Estate`" (i.e., `GICS Sub Industry` contains
#    either `"Gold"` or `"REITs"`).
#    You need to do it in three steps:
#      - First, use `mutate()` and `factor()` to convert the `GICS Sector`
#        variable of `securities` from character to a factor. Its levels should
#        be the `unique()` values of `GICS Sector`.
#      - Second, create a tibble named `securities_sectored` that contain
#        only the companies that do not belong to those that you want (see below).
#        Note that `securities_sectored` should contain an additional column
#        `GICS Sector truncated` that contains the top 6 factors in `GICS Sector`
#        and all the others lumped into an additional level `"Other"`.
#      - Third, use `anti_join()` on `securities` and `securities_sectored` to
#        create `securities_selected`, which contains only the rows that actually
#        meet the requirements above by deleting the rows from `securities`
#        that are in `securities_sectored`.
#    To achieve the second step, you can use:
#        - `mutate()` along with `fct_infreq()` and `fct_lump()` to
#          reorder the sectors by frequency of occurence and lump
#          all except the top 6 into a single level `"Other"`.
#        - `filter()` to select the sectors that do not belong to the
#          top 6 (i.e., the ones with the level `"Other"`).
#        - `filter()`  along with `str_detect()` to additionally filter out
#           the observations whose `GICS Sub Industry` contains neither
#           `"Gold"` nor `"REITs"`. In the pattern, you can use a
#           regular expression with or (represented by the alternation
#           symbol `"|"`) to do that.
#    To help you, `securities` is as in part 1, except that the `GICS Sector`
#    column is a factor whose levels print to
#    `Levels: Industrials ... Telecommunications Services`.
#    `securities_sectored` should print to:

#    4. Convert the column name of `fund` from `Ticker Symbol`

#    `Period Ending Year` and `Gross Margin`.
#    Save the new tibble as `fund_time`.
#    To do that, you can use:

#         (You can use pipe %>% on `Period Ending` inside `mutate()`)

# 6. Load the library `ggplot2`.
#    Generate histograms of `Gross Margin` in different sectors in different periods

#    To do so, you can:
#      - create the plot by calling `ggplot()` on `securities_fund`,
#        with `mapping = aes()`, in which argument `fill` should set to `Period
#        Ending Year` and `x` should set to `Gross Margin`.
#      - adding `geom_histogram()` with `binwidth` set to `10`, `color` set to
#        `black` and `fill` set to `orange`.
#      - then facet on `GICS Sector` using `facet_wrap()`.
#      - `labs()` to format the labels such that:
#           - `title = "Gross margin distributed differently in different sectors"`
#           - `x = "Gross Margin (%)"`
#           - `y = "Count (n)"`
#      - then add the light theme using `theme_light()`.

# 7. Join the two tibbles `raw_time` with `securities_fund` to get each
#    company's stock price trend in each year with its corresponding
#    `Gross Margin` in that year.
#    (Note: the column you want to join the tables by is `Ticker symbol`,
#    make sure they have the exact same name before joining).
#    To do that, you can do the following:
#       - first convert the column name `symbol` of `raw_time` to `Ticker symbol`.
#         (Hint: use `dplyr::rename()`).
#       - use `mutate()`, and `year()` to extract the year of the price happening.
#       - use `dplyr::select()` to select only the following columns:
#            `Ticker symbol`, `close`, `open`, `date`,`year`
#       - use `left_join` with argument `by` set to `Ticker symbol`.
#       - use `filter()` to delete the rows where the `Perior Ending Year` is not
#         corresponding to the date of the price.
#    Save the generated tibble into `full_stock`.
#    `full_stock` should print to:
#    # A tibble: 246,615 x 9

# 10. Caculate the annual "Rate of Return" (RoR) on the securities in `full_stock`.
#     "Rate of Return" is defined as the net gain or loss on an investment
#      over a specified time period, calculated as a percentage of
#      the investment’s initial cost.
#      (Namely, RoR = (current value - initial value) / initial value)
#      To calculate this index on securities in `full_stock`, you can:
#         - group the stock prices by `Period Ending Year` and `Ticker symbol`
#           using `group_by()`
#         - select the record of start of the year and end of the year
#           by using `filter()` to select `date` equal to `min(date)` or
#           `max(date)`
#         - `mutate()` the `date` to `"open"` if it is equal to `min(date)`,
#           otherwise `"close"`. (use `ifelse()` inside `mutate()`)
#         - use `pivot_longer()` to extract `"open"` and `"close"` from `date`.
#           To do that, inside `pivot_longer()`, set `c("open", "close")`
#           as first argument, and then `names_to` as `"status"`, `values_to`
#           as `"price"`. This will add two columns recording the opening
#           and closing price for each row.
#         - use `filter()` to select the right `status` for each row by
#           condition `date == status`.
#         - use`summarize()` to calculate the `RoR` for each stock in
#           each year. Inside `summarize()`, use `diff()` to calculate the
#           price difference of open price and close price and divide the
#           difference by `price[1]` which represents the open price.
#         - use `left_join()` to add the annual `RoR` to `securities_fund`
#           by joining with `securities_fund` on `Ticker symbol` and
#           `Period Ending Year`.
#           (Set `by` to `c("Ticker symbol", "Period Ending Year")`.)
#         - use `droplevels()` drop the unselected sectors.
#     Save the generated tibble into `return_stock`.
#     `return_stock` should print to:
#     # A tibble: 980 x 6
#     # Groups:   Period Ending Year [5]
