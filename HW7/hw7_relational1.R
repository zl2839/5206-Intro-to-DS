# HW7: Reproducing a paper figure
#'
# This exercise was inspired by exercise 6 in Chapter 2 of
# [Bit By Bit: Social Research in the Digital Age]
# (https://www.bitbybitbook.com/en/1st-ed/observing-behavior/observing-activities/)
# by Matt Salganik.
#'
# "In a widely discussed paper, Michel and colleagues
# ([2011](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1199644)) analyzed the content of
# more than five million digitized books in an attempt to identify long-term
# cultural trends. The data that they used has now been released as the Google
# NGrams dataset, and so we can use the data to replicate and extend some of
# their work.
#'
# In one of the many results in the paper, Michel and colleagues argued that we
# are forgetting faster and faster. For a particular year, say “1883,” they
# calculated the proportion of all terms published in each year between 1875
# and 1975 that were “1883”. They reasoned that this proportion is a measure of
# the interest in events that happened in that year. In their figure 3a, they
# plotted the usage trajectories for three years: 1883, 1910, and 1950. These
# three years share a common pattern: little use before that year, then a
# spike, then decay."
#'
# They noticed the rate of decay for each year mentioned seemed to increase
# with time and they argued that this means that we are forgetting the past
# faster and faster.
#'
# The full paper can be found
# [here](https://aidenlab.org/papers/Science.Culturomics.pdf), and you are
# going to replicate part of figure 3a.
#'
# To do so we will focus on the mention of terms that can represent years
# (strings like "1765", "1886", "1897", "1937"...). The raw data was fetched
# for you from the [Google Books NGram Viewer website]
# (http://storage.googleapis.com/books/ngrams/books/datasetsv2.html) and
# preprocessed into two files:
# - `data/mentions_yearly_counts.tsv` contains the number of mentions of
#   different terms per year and the number of books retrieved where the term
#   appeared each year
#   (one row per term per year)
# - `data/yearly_total_counts.csv` contains the total number of mentions of all
#   terms per year as well as the number of pages and books retrived each year
#   (one row per year)
#'
# 1. Load the `readr` package.
#    Read in `data/mentions_yearly_counts.tsv` using `read_tsv()` and assign
#    the resulting tibble to `terms_mentions`.
#    Set the parameters of `read_tsv()` in order to make sure of the following:
#    - column names should be, in order: `term`, `year`, `n_mentions`,
#      `book_count`
#    - column types should be, in order: `character`, `integer`, `integer`,
#      `integer`
#    Hint: you can use parameters `col_names` and `col_types` to achieve this.
#    `terms_mentions` should print to:
#    # A tibble: 53,393 x 4
#       term   year n_mentions book_count
#       <chr> <int>      <int>      <int>

#      `integer`
#    Hint: you can use parameters `col_names` and `col_types` to achieve this.
#    Note: the reason you should read in the `total_mentions` as a `double`
#    column is that it contains very large integers that don't fit within the
#    bounds of numbers represented by the `integer` type in R. Using a
#    double-precision number is our only recourse.
