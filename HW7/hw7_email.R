# HW7: email
#'
# In this exercise, you will perform data analysis with emails within 184 people
# from year 1998 to 2001.
# 1. Let's first read in the required datasets.
#    Load the `readr` package.
#      - Use `read_csv()` to load the `people.csv` data set from `data` folder
#        and assign it to a tibble `people`. This data set contains information
#        about the 184 people who sent emails between each other.
#      - Use `read_csv()` to load the `email.csv` data set from `data` folder
#        and assign it to a tibble `email`. This data set contains information about
#        each email sent: time, sender and receiver.

library(readr)
people <- read_csv("data/people.csv")
email <- read_csv("data/email.csv")

# 2. `onset` variable in `email` is the time when the email is sent, but we can
#    see that it is shown in a weird way. It turns out that it represents how
#    many seconds from the start time. Let's convert it to normal
#    time stamps.
#    Note: `1998-01-01` is encoded as 883612800 in `onset`.
#      - Load the `dplyr` package.
#      - Load the `lubridate` package
#      - Use `mutate()` to create a new variable `time` in `email` dataset.
#    We can obtain `time` by following the next three steps:
#      - Substract the `onset` by 883612800 to get the seconds difference with
#        `1998-01-01`.
#      - Use `as.POSIXct()` to change the seconds difference into normal timestamp.
#        Specify the argument `origin = "1998-01-01"`.
#      - Use `with_tz()`to change the time zone to UTC ,by passing
#        `tzone = "UTC"`.
#    Save your generated tibble into `email_w_time` whose first few rows should
#    look like:
#    A tibble: 38,131 x 9
#    onset terminus  tail  head onset.censored terminus.censor… duration edge.id

email_w_time <- email %>%
  mutate(date = with_tz(as.POSIXct(onset - 883612800, origin = "1998-01-01"), tzone = "UTC"))

# 3. Now let's take a look into the `people` dataset.
#    We can see some missing values in `person_name` column, but we can get a
#    person's name using his/her `email_id`.
#    For example, Albert Meyers's email ID is just `"albert.meyers"`.
#    To fill in missing values with email ID, let's first create a function
#    `email_id_to_name` to tranform `"albert.meyers"` into `"Albert Meyers"`.
#    You need to:
#      - Load the `stringr` package.
#      - Load the `purrr` package.
#      - Create a function  function `email_id_to_name` that take a string input
#    named `email_id` and returns the name extracted from the email id.
#    To do that, you can use:
#      - `str_split()` to extract the first and last name from `email_id`,
#        split by `"\\."`.
#      - `map_char` and `paste0()` to combine the first and last name using
#        `collapse = " "`.
#      - `str_trim()` to remove whitespace from start and end of string.
#      - `str_to_title()` to capitalize each word.
#    Name your.

library(stringr)
library(purrr)
email_id_to_name <- function(email_id) {
  name = email_id %>% str_split("\\.") %>% 
  map_chr(paste0, collapse = " ") %>%
  str_trim() %>% str_to_title()
  return(name)
}

# 4. Now let's implement the function you just created to our `people` tibble.
#    If `person_name` is not missing, do not modify it. If it is missing, change
#    `person_name` to the output of `email_id_to_name` by taking `email_id` as
#    input, you can use `email_id %>% email_id_to_name`.
#    To do that, you can use:
#      - `mutate()` and `ifelse()` to change the column `person_name`.
#      - `is.na()` to check if the `person_name` is missing.
#    Save your generated tibble into `people_new`, whose first few rows should
#    look like:
#    A tibble: 184 x 5
#    vertex.names email_id        person_name      role           dept
#    <dbl>        <chr>           <chr>            <chr>          <chr>

people_new <- people %>%
  mutate(person_name = ifelse(is.na(person_name), email_id_to_name(email_id), person_name))


# 5. We still have `NA` in `role` and `dept`. This time, we want to fill in the
#    missing values in `role` with `Employee` and missing values in `dept` as
#    `General`. Let's create a new tibble `people_new2` that fills such gaps...
#    and more!
#    First, load the `tidyr` package and create a vector `role_order =`
#    `c("Employee", "Trader", "Manager", "Managing Director", "Director",`
#    `"In House Lawyer", "Vice President", "President", "CEO")`
#    Now, can fill the missing roles and make it a factor using the levels
#    in `role_order`. To do that, you can use:
#      - `replace_na()` to fill in the missing values in these two columns.
#         Remember the missing values in `role` should now become `Employee`
#         and the missing values in `dept` should now become `General`.
#      - `mutate()` to change `role` into a factor with `factor()` and
#         specify `levels = role_order` to change `role` into a factor according
#         to our order.
#    Save your generated tibble into `people_new2` whose first few rows should
#    look like:
#    # A tibble: 184 x 5
#    vertex.names email_id        person_name      role           dept
#    <dbl>        <chr>           <chr>            <fct>          <chr>

role_order =c("Employee", "Trader", "Manager", "Managing Director", "Director", "In House Lawyer", "Vice President", "President", "CEO")
people_new2 <- people_new %>%
  replace_na(list(role = "Employee", dept = "General")) %>%
  mutate(role = factor(role, levels = role_order))

# 6. Let's combine the two datasets `email_w_time` and `people_new2` together,
#    we want to keep the information about every email and add the name, email ID,
#    role and department for the sender as well as for the receiver.
#    The numbers in `tail` and `head` represent different people. The key to join
#    this two tibbles are `tail` and `head` from `email_w_time`, and `vertex.names`
#    from `people_new2`. In other words, you need to use two `left_join()` to
#    add first the information of the receiver and then of the sender.
#    You will also need to update the names of the columns added by the joins.
#    To add information of a receiver, you can use:
#      - `left_join()` to combine `email_w_time` and `people_new2`, specify
#        `by = c("tail"="vertex.names")` because `tail` represents the receiver
#        of an email.
#      - `rename()` to change the column names to specify that they're the
#        receiver information: change `email_id` to `receiver_email`, `person_name`
#        to `receiver`, `role` to `receiver_role` and `dept` to `receiver_dept`.
#    Then, to add information of a sender, you can similarly use:
#      - `left_join()` to combine with `people_new` again, this time with
#        `by = c("head"="vertex.names")` .
#      - `rename()` to change the column names to specify that they're the
#         sender information: change `email_id` to `sender_email`, `person_name`
#         to `sender`, `role` to `sender_role` and `dept` to `sender_dept`.
#    Finally, you can use:
#       -  `select()` to only keep the `date`, sender information and receiver
#          information (each has 4 columns with email ID, name, role and department).
#      - `starts_with()` to select all the four columns of sender / receiver
#        information.
#    Save your generated tibble into `t1`, which should have 9 columns, in the order of
#    `date`, `sender_email` `sender`, `sender_role`, `sender_dept`, `receiver_email`,
#    `receiver`, `receiver_role`, `receiver_dept`.
#    The first fews rows of `t1` should look like:
#    A tibble: 38,131 x 9
#    date                sender_email sender sender_role sender_dept receiver_email

# 7. We noticed that there are emails that one person sent to him/her self
#    with the same `send_email` and `receiver_email`. We do not care about these
#    emails and want to filter them out.
#    - Use `filter` to filter out rows in `t1` whose `sender_email` is exactly
#    the same as `receiver_email`.
#    To simply our analysis with time the email is sent, we want to further
#    parse the information in `date` by creating new columns named `year`, `month`,
#    `day` and `hour`. To do that, you can use:
#      - `mutate()` to create the new columns `year`, `month`, `day` and `hour`.
#      - `year()` to extract `year` in `date`.
#      - `month()` to extract `month` in `date`.
#      - `day()` to extract `day` in `date`.
#      - `hour()` to extract `hour` in `date`.

# 11.Then let's visualize it. We want to plot the `count` against `date`
#    with colors spliting by `sender_role`.
#    Use:
#      - `ggplot()` to initialize a ggplot object.
#         Set its arguments `data`, `mapping`.
#      - `geom_point()` to plot a histogram for hour.
