# HW6: ggplot2
#'
# In this exercise, you have to recreate the figures found at
# the left of the instructions.
# We suggest functions you can use to create the plots, but
# you are free to use the method you are the most comfortable with.
# Make sure that the figures look exactly like the ones you are supposed to create.
#'
# The purpose of this task is to get familiar with ggplot.
# Throughout the exercise, please use `theme_light()` as your base theme.
# For graphs with titles, make the format as
# `theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5), plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5))`.
#'
# 1. Load the `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `purrr`, `ggrepel` and `readr` packages.
#    Use `read_csv()` to load the `autompg.csv` data set from `data` folder and
#    assign it to a tibble `autompg`.
#    Create a tibble `efficiency_by_manufacturer` of dimension 398 x 11 on the base of `autompg`.
#    The dataset should transfer the `model_year` into a factor variable. It should also
#    Create a new column called `car_made` that extracts the car manufacturer from `car_name`.
#    The dataset should Create a new column called `efficiency`.
#    The formula of `efficiency` is `mpg / weight`.
#    To do that, you can use:
#    - `mutate()` and `as.factor()` to transfer the `model_year` into a factor variable.
#    - `map_chr()` and `strsplit` to extract the car manufacturer from `car_name`.
#    - `mutate()` to create a new column called `car_made` and store the list of car manufacturer names.
#    - `mutate()` to build a new column called `efficiency` and use the formula above to assign values.
#    To check your solution, `efficiency_by_manufacturer` prints to:
#    # A tibble: 398 x 11
