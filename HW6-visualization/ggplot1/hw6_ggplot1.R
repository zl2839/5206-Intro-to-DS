# In this exercise, you have to recreate the figures found at
# the left of the instructions.
# We suggest functions you can use to create the plots, but
# you are free to use the method you are the most comfortable with.
# Make sure that the figures look exactly like the ones you are supposed to create.
#'
# The purpose of this task is to get familiar with ggplot.
# Throughout the exercise, please use `theme_light()` as your base theme.
# For graphs with titles, make the format as
# `theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5), plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5))`.
#'
# 1. Load the `ggplot2`, `readr` and `tidyr` packages.
#    Use `read_csv` to load the `abalone.csv` data set from `data` folder and
#    use `drop_na()` to drop NAs, then assign it to a tibble `abalone`.
#    To check your solution, `abalone` prints to:
#    # A tibble: 4,077 x 9
