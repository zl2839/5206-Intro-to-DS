# HW6: football
#'
# In this problem, we will continue to play with the football dataset from HW5.
# Throughout the exercise:
#    - Use `%>%` to structure your operations.
#    - Do NOT use `for`, `while` or `repeat` loops.
#'
# In this exercise, you have to recreate the figures found at 
# the left of the instructions.
# We suggest functions you can use to create the plots, but 
# you are free to use the method you are the most comfortable with.
# Make sure that the figures look exactly like the ones you are supposed to create.
#'
# 1. Load the following packages: `ggplot2`, `viridis`, `lubridate` and
#    `tidyverse`. Load the file `data/football.csv` and save it into tibble `fu`.
#    Draw a box plot of total home goals from 2001 to 2019 of team England,
#    Germany, France, Belgium, Italy and Spain.
#    To do that, first create a tibble `fu1` containing three columns
#    `home_team`, `year` and `total`. You can use :
#      - `year()` to extract year from `date` and `filter()` to filter years
#      from 2001 to 2019, and to only keep the 6 countries in `home_team` column.
#      - `group_by()` and `dplyr::summarise()` to count the total goals of each team
#      in each year.
#    `fu1` should print to :
#    # A tibble: 114 x 3
#    # Groups:   home_team [6]
#    home_team  year total
#    <chr>     <dbl> <dbl>
#    1 Belgium    2001    16
#    2 Belgium    2002     6
#    3 Belgium    2003    11
#    4 Belgium    2004     3
#    5 Belgium    2005    14
#    6 Belgium    2006     8
#    7 Belgium    2007     7
#    8 Belgium    2008     7
#    9 Belgium    2009    12
#    10 Belgium    2010     6
#    # … with 104 more rows

# 2. Then, to draw the plot of `fu1`, use:
#     - `ggplot` to initialize a ggplot object and specify the variables to plot.
#     -  use `fill` to fill the color of boxes to `home_team`.
#     - `geom_boxplot` to plot boxplot, set argument `alpha` to 0.6.
#        It will make the color lighter.
#     - `scale_fill_viridis` to use viridis color scale.
#        Set `discrete` to TRUE.
#     - `labs()` to format the labels such that:
#      - `title = "Six European National Teams Home Goals from 2000 to 2019"`
#      - `x = "Teams"`
#      - `y = "Goals Overall (n)"`

# 3. Before plotting, first create a tibble `fu2` containing the relevant data.
#    You can use:
#      - `select()` to select the relevant columns.
#        Make sure you use `dplyr::select`.
#      - `mutate()` and `year()` to change the column `date` to its

#      - `filter()` to filter years from 2013~2019 and `home_team`
#        as England.
#    `fu2` should look like the following:
#    # A tibble: 38 x 4

# 4. Load the package `ggridges` for plotting.
#    Draw a ridge line plot to analyze the distribution of goals of England in

#    To draw the plot, use:
#     - `ggplot` to initialize a ggplot object and specify the variables to plot.
#        You should plot `home_score` against `year`, group by `home_score`,
#        and set `fill` to `home_score`.
#     - `geom_density_ridges` to plot ridge lines, with argument `alpha` set
#        to 0.6. This will make the color lighter.
#     - `labs()` to format the labels such that:
#      - `title = "England National Team Home Goals Distribution 
#                  in International Contests from 2013 to 2019"`

#    Before plotting, please do data manipulations to create a tibble `fu3`
#    containing the relevant data.
#    To do that, you can use:
#      - `select()` to select the three columns `"home_team", "tournament", "date"`.
#      - `mutate()` and `factor()` to convert the `tournament` column
#         into factors with given levels.

#     - `scale_fill_viridis(discrete=TRUE)` to use the viridis color scale.
#     - `theme()` to set the x-axis label rotate 45 degrees.
#        (Hint : Use `element_text` to set `axis.text.x` correctly)
#     - `labs()` to format the labels such that:

#    Before plotting, please do data manipulations to create a tibble `fu4`.

#    To do that, you can use :
#      - `filter()` and `str_detect` to filter by `World Cup` tournaments.
#         Note : Don't take into account the `qualifications` games.
#      - `pivot_longer()` to stretch the game records so that each row is
#         team-wise record.
#      - `group_by()` and `distinct()` to count the attendance of the team
#         in each World Cup year.
#         (Note: it is counted only one attendance no matter how many
#          games the team played in that year)
#      - `dplyr::mutate()` to get the total number of attendances as column `attendance`.
#      - `filter()` to only get the teams with more than 8 attendances.
#      - `arrange()` and `desc()` to order the result in descending order of `attendance`.
#    `fu4` should print to :
