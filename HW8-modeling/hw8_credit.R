# HW8: Credit
#
# In this exercise, you will analyze a credit data set with
# a person's basic information and his/her balance. The goal is to predict
# the person's balance by using the other variables.
#
# 1. Let's first read in the required datasets.
#    Load the `readr` package.
#      - Use `read_csv()` to load the `credit.csv` data set from the `data`
#        folder and assign it to a tibble `credit`.
## Do not modify this line!
library(readr)
credit = read_csv('data/credit.csv')


# 2. Change `Student`, `Married` and `Ethnicity` to factor variables instead of
#    characters. Further, add a new variable `Limit_per_card` which equals the
#    value of `Limit` over `Cards` and sort the tibble by `Balance` in
#    ascending order. To do that, you need to :
#      - Load the `dplyr` package.
#    You can use:
#      - `mutate()` and `factor()` to change the three columns into factor.
#      - `mutate()` to add the new variable.
#      - `arrange()` to sort the tibble.
#    Save your new tibble into `credit_new` whose first few rows should look
#    like:
#    # A tibble: 400 x 12
#    Income Limit Rating Cards   Age Education Gender Student Married Ethnicity
#    <dbl> <dbl>  <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>     <dbl> <fct>  <chr>   <fct>   <fct>

#    … with 390 more rows, and 2 more variables: Balance <dbl>,
#    Limit_per_card <dbl>

#    We want to perform a linear regression on `Balance` for people. Let's
#    first try to find some patterns with visualization.

# 3. Create a facet for different `Ethnicity` group, within each plot,
#    draw a boxplot of `Balance` aginst `Student`. To do that, you need to :

#      - `geom_boxplot()` to plot a boxplot for `Balance` against `Student`
#      - `facet_wrap()` to create a facet for `Ethnicity`
#      - `labs()` to format the labels such that:

  geom_point()+geom_smooth()+
  labs(title = "The balance goes higher as per card limit goes up",
       subtitle = "This relationship is nonlinear",
       x = "Limit per card (USD)",y = "Balance (USD)")+my_theme
  

# 5. We can see the relationship between `Balance` and `Limit_per_card` is
#    nonlinear, but we are trying to fit a linear model, so let's try some
#    transformation on the variable.
#    Create a new variable `log_limit_per_card` in `credit_new`, which equals
#    the logarithm of `Limit_per_card`.
#    Also remove all the observations if the balance is less or equal to 0,
#    because those mess with our regression.
#    To do that, you can use:
#      - `mutate()` and `log()` to create the new variable.
#      - `filter()` to filter out the observations with balance less
#        or equal to 0
#    Then plot `Blance` against `log_limit_per_card` now, still split by
#    `Student`. What is your finding now?
#    To do that, you can use:
#      - `ggplot()` to initialize a ggplot object.
#        Set its arguments `data` and `mapping`. Don't forget to specify
#        `color = Student`.
#      - `geom_point()` to do a scatter plot for `Balance`
#         against `log_limit_per_card`.
#      - `geom_smooth()` to add the regression line.
#      - `labs()` to format the labels such that:
#        - `title = "The balance goes higher as log of per card limit goes up"`.
#        - `subtitle = "This relationship looks more linear after transformation"`.
#        - `x = "Log of Limit per card (USD)"`.
#        - `y = "Balance (USD)"`.
#      - `theme_light()` to change the theme of plots.
#      - `theme()` to change the title and subtitle to the middle of the plot.
#        - Set its argument `plot.title` using `element_text(hjust = 0.5)`.
#        - Set its argument `plot.subtitle` using `element_text(hjust = 0.5)`.
#    Save your plot to `g3`.
## Do not modify this line!
credit_new = credit_new %>% mutate(log_limit_per_card = log(Limit_per_card)) %>% 
  filter(Balance > 0)
g3 = ggplot(credit_new, aes(log_limit_per_card,Balance,color = Student))+

# 6. Now let's fit a simple linear regression model `m1` on `Balance` use
#    `log_limit_per_card`, `Student` and their second order iteration.
#    Based on `credit_new`, save your prediction residuals into a column
#    `resid1`, save your predictions into a column `pred1` and save this new
#    tibble into `credit_pred`.
#    To do this, you need to:
#      - Load `modelr` package
#    You can use:
#      - `lm()` to fit a linear regression, save the model to `m1`.
#      - `add_residuals` to add residuals to the new tibble `credit_pred`.
#      - `add_predictions` to add predictions to the new tibble `credit_pred`.
#    The expected output for `m1 %>% broom::tidy()` should be:

# 7. Let's check if our model captures the relationship we observe in `g3`.

#        in `Predictions` into one column named `Balance` and use `Type` to
#        characterize if it is true or predicted.
#        - set `names_to = "Type`
#        - set `values_to = "Balance"`
#      - `ggplot()` to initialize a ggplot object.

#        - set `linetype = Type` in `aes()`
#        - specify `se = FALSE`

# 8. Now we want to visualize the distribution of residuals to check our model

# 9. Now let's visualize the predictions and true balance against other
#    variables(e.g. `Rating`) to see if the model is doing well.
#    To do that, you can use:
#      - `ggplot()` to initialize a ggplot object.

# 10. Now let's add one more predictor `Rating` in our model.
#    Fit another linear model `m2` using these variables:
#    `log_limit_per_card`, `Student`, their second order iteration, and `Rating`.
#    Again, save your prediction residuals into a column
#    `resid2`, save your predictions into a column `pred2` into `credit_pred`.
#    Then visualize the distribution of residuals.
#    To do this, you can use:

#      - `add_residuals` to add residuals to the new tibble `credit_pred`.
#      - `add_predictions` to add predictions to the new tibble `credit_pred`.
#      - `ggplot()` to initialize a ggplot object.
#        Set its arguments `data` and `mapping`.

#      - `geom_point()` to add the scatter plot of residuals.
#      - `labs()` to format the labels such that:
#        - `title = "The residual goes up as balance goes up"`.
#        - `subtitle = "But the slope and the range residuals has decreased a lot"`.
#        - `x = "Balance (USD)"`.
#        - `y = "Residuals (USD)"`.
#      - `theme_light()` to change the theme of plots.
#      - `theme()` to change the title and subtitle to the middle of the plot.
#        - Set its argument `plot.title` using `element_text(hjust = 0.5)`.
#        - Set its argument `plot.subtitle` using `element_text(hjust = 0.5)`.
#    Save your plot to `g6`.
#    And your expected output for `m2 %>% broom::tidy()` shoule be:

# 12. By iterating the process above, we can include more variables which
#    improves our model.
#    Let's fit our final model `m3` using these variables:
#    `log_limit_per_card`, `Student`, their second order interaction,
#    `Rating`, `Income`, `Limit` and `Cards`.
#    Again, save your prediction residuals into a column
#    `resid3`, save your predictions into a column `pred3` into `credit_pred`.
#    Then visualize the distribution of residuals.
#    To do this, you can use:
#      - `lm()` to fit a linear regression, save the model to `m3`.
#      - `add_residuals` to add residuals to the new tibble `credit_pred`.
#      - `add_predictions` to add predictions to the new tibble `credit_pred`.
#      - `ggplot()` to initialize a ggplot object.
#        Set its arguments `data` and `mapping`.
#      - `geom_ref_line()` to add a reference line.
#        - specify `h=0` to use the x-axis as the reference line.
#      - `geom_point()` to add the scatter plot of residuals.
#      - `labs()` to format the labels such that:
#        - `title = "The residuals are randomly distributed around x-axis"`.
#        - `subtitle = "Our model is pretty good!"`.
#        - `x = "Balance (USD)"`.
#        - `y = "Residuals (USD)"`.
#      - `theme_light()` to change the theme of plots.
#      - `theme()` to change the title and subtitle to the middle of the plot.
#        - Set its argument `plot.title` using `element_text(hjust = 0.5)`.
#        - Set its argument `plot.subtitle` using `element_text(hjust = 0.5)`.
#    Save your plot to `g8`.

# 13. Let's fit the previous model within every `Ethnicity` group, and save
#    the model information into `credit_model`.
#    To do this, you need to:
#      - Load the `purrr` package.
#      - Create a function `f1` that takes an input tibble `df` and perform a
#      linear regression of `Balance` against  `log_limit_per_card`, `Student`,
#      their second order interaction, `Rating`, `Income`, `Limit`, and `Cards`
#      within the input `df`. In other words, `f1(credit_new)`
#      should return `m3`.
#    You can use:
#      - `lm()` to fit a linear regression with formula `Balance ~
#        log_limit_per_card * Student + Rating + Income + Limit + Cards`.
#      - `group_by()` to group `credit_new` by `Ethnicity`
#      - `nest()` to let each row represents a group
#      - `map()` to map the model `m2` to every group
#      - `mutate()`, `map2()` and `add_residuals()` to add the prediction
#       residuals to each group
#      - `unnest()` to unnest the residuals
#    Your final output `credit_model` is a tibble containing the model
#    information for each group and the first few rows should look like:
