# HW8: City Weather Prediction
#
# This exercise is based on historical hourly weather data 2012-2017 obtained from
# [Kaggle]
# (https://www.kaggle.com/selfishgene/historical-hourly-weather-data#wind_direction.csv).
# The dataset contains approximatelyl 5 years of high temporal resolution
# data of various weather attributes, such as temperature, humidity,
# air pressure, etc. This data is available for 30 US and Canadian Cities,
# as well as 6 Israeli cities.
# Each attribute has its own file and is organized such that the rows are
# the time axis (it's the same time axis for all files), and the columns are
# the different cities (it's the same city ordering for all files as well).
#
# 1. Load the packages `tidyverse`, `lubridate`.
#    Use `read_csv` to load the file `temperature_cities.csv` located in the
#    folder `/course/data`.
#    Store the data into a tibble `temperature`.
#    `temperature` should print to:
#    # A tibble: 45,253 x 5
#    datetime            Vancouver Phoenix Miami `New York`

# 2. As you can see, each city is represented by each column of the tibbles
#    (i.e., humidity variable is spread across multiple columns).
#    Our goal is to create a tibble `temperature_full` with only one column
#    that contains the data from all cities.
#    We need to tidy it. You can use :
#      - `pivot_longer()` to make rowise record for each city.
#      - `mutate()` to add the following extra columns:
#        - `temperature`: convert `temperature` from Kelvin to Celsius
#           scale. (Kelvin - 273.15 = Celsius)
#        - `yday` using `yday()` that contain the day of the corresponding
#           date in `datetime`.
#        - `hour` using `hour()` that contain the hour of the corresponding
#           date in `datetime` and `factor()` to make it a factor variable.
#        - `yearfrac` that represent the fraction of this day in this year.
#           (Use `yday(make_date(year(datetime), 12, 31))` to calculate the
#           total days in this year. The fraction is just the `yday` divided
#           by total days in this year.)
#      - `drop_na()` to drop `NA` values of this tibble.
#    `temperature_full` should print to:
#    # A tibble: 178,616 x 6

#     - Create a linear model object using `lm()`:

#    Save the generated model object to `model0`.
#     - Use `add_predictions()` and `add_residuals()` to add two

#       result of `model0` we defined.
#    Save the generated tibble into `temperature_ny_model0`.

#           Set arguments `size` to be 1 and `col` to be `"red"`.

# 6. We now want to be able to capture the cyclicality.

#    Then fit linear model on the transformed variables using `lm()` and
#    `cyclic()`, that is regress the `temperature` and `cyclic(yearfrac)`.
#    Save the fitted model in `model1`.
#    Then:
#     - Use `add_predictions()` and `add_residuals()` to add two
#       new columns to `temperature_ny` representing the prediction
#       result of `model1` we defined.

# 8. Use boxplot to visualize the residuals over each hour of the day.
#    To do that, you can use:

#        and `y` axis to be the residual.
#      - `geom_boxplot()` to draw the plot.
#      - `labs()` to set `title` to

# 9. We now want to be able to learn the local variations of the temperature
#    by adding `hour` as an intercept in the regression.
#    The goal is to account for the variations between day and night.
#    To do that, declare a new model called `model2` using `lm()` and `cyclic()`.
#    Save the model to `model2`.
#    Combine the prediction result of `model1` and `model2` in the following steps:
#     - use `gather_predictions()` to get the prediction results from both
#       `model1` and `model2`.
#     - use `gather_residuals()` to get the prediction residuals from both
#       `model1` and `model2`.
#     - use `left_join()` to join the above two tibbles.
#     - use `mutate()` and `factor()` to convert `model` column into a factor
#       with `levels()` set to `c("model1", "model2")`.
#    Save the generated tibble into `temperature_ny_model2`.
#    `temperature_ny_model2` should print to:
#    # A tibble: 88,920 x 9

#         and `y` axis to be the residual.
#      - `geom_boxplot()` to draw the plot.
#      - `facet_wrap()` to draw individual plot for each model.
#      - `labs()` to set `title` to
#          `"Including the hour captures the time-of-day effect"`,
#          `x` to be `"Hour"` and `y` to be `"Residuals (C)"`.
#      - `theme_light()` to set a light background.
#     Save the ggplot object into `ny_temp_residual2`.
#     We notice that the splines seem to learn local variations in the data,
#     without overfitting.

# 12. Now, we choose `model2` as our best model to fit temperature trend.
#     We want to deploy it to model multiple cities at once.
#     To do that, please do the following:
#       - create a function `my_model` that takes tibble
#         `df` as argument and return a fitted `model2` on the tibble.
#         (use the same formula as `model2`, `temperature ~ cyclic(yearfrac)`).
#         You can assume that `df` has columns `yearfrac` and `temperature`.
#       - Use `temperature_full`, fit `model2` on each city by doing
#         the following:
#          - use `group_by()` and `nest()` to group tibbles according to
#            city.
#          - use `mutate()` and `purrr::map()` to fit the model to each city
#            in `data` using `my_model` function.
#     Save the defined function as `my_model` and the generated tibble as
#     `by_city`. It should print to:
#     # A tibble: 4 x 3
#     # Groups:   city [4]

# 14. Now, we want to test the model performance in four seasons using simulated data.
#     We will generate our test data, which consists of `yearfrac` ranging from
#     0 to 0.75 with interval 0.25 and hour pulled from `temperature_full`.
#     To do that, you can use:
#       - `crossing` in which we set:
#          - `yearfrac` to be a vector generated from `seq(0, 0.75, 0.25)`.
#          - `hour` using `pull(hour)` on `temperature_full` and then
#            `unique()` to select unique hours.
#     Save the tibble into `test_df`.
#     `test_df` should print to:
#     # A tibble: 96 x 2
#    yearfrac hour
#    <dbl> <fct>
#    1        0 0

# 15. Apply our model in `by_city` to `test_df`.
#     To do that, please do the following:
#       - use `mutate()` to create column `pred`:
#          - first, use `map()` to apply `predict()` to `model` with
#            argument `newdata` set to `test_df`.
#          - secondly, use `map()` to apply `enframe()` to the `pred` column
#          - thirdly, use `map()` and `bind_cols()` to concatenate the predicted
#            temperature with `test_df`.
#       - use `unnest()` get unnested tibble.
#       - use `dplyr::select()` to get all the columns except `data`, `model`
#         and `name`.
#       - use `mutate()` to formulate the columns:
#          - use `factor` to convert `yearfrac` to factor and `fct_recode()` to
#            rename the factor name as `"Winter"` for `yearfrac` equal to `0`,
#            `"Spring"` for `yearfrac` equal to `0.25`, `"Summer"` for
#            `yearfrac` equal to `0.5` and `"Autumn"` for `yearfrac` equal to
#             `0.75`.
#          - convert `hour` back to a number using `as.numeric()` (don't forget
#            to substract 1).
#    Save the generate tibble into `by_city_pred`.
#    `by_city_pred` should print to:
