#
# Throughout the exercise:
#    - Do NOT use `for`, `while` or `repeat` loops.
#    - Use `%>%` to structure your operations.
#    - Use `my_theme` that you will create in the problem 1
#    for all the plots.
#    - Please specify `dplyr::` when you use `select()`.
#
#
# 1. Load the packages `tidyverse`, `modelr` and `broom`.
#    Use `read_csv()` to read the datasets from data folder:
#       - `college.csv` into a tibble `college`.
#    To check your solution, `college` prints to:

# 2. Create a tibble of dim 777 x 4. Replace all the `.` with `_`.
#    The dataset should sum up `Outstate`, `Room_Board`, `Books`,
#    `Personal` and `Expend` costs, and store the sum into a new
#    column called `total_cost`.
#    Then transform `Private` into a factor variable.
#    Finally, choose the
#    `total_cost`, `Private`, `Top10perc` and `PhD`columns.
#    To do this, you can use:
#      - `rename_all()` and `str_replace_all()` to replace `.` with `_`.
#      (hint1: `rename_all()` has been vectorized so it can
#      work like `map()`.
#      hint2: in order to escape the `.`, you can use `\\.`.)
#      - `nest()` to combine `Outstate`, `Room_Board`, `Books`,
#      `Personal` and `Expend` into one column called `total_cost`.
#      - `mutate()` to create `total_cost` and transform `Private`
#      into factors.
#      (hint: you can use `map_dbl()` and `sum()` to calculate the
#      total cost of each row.)
#      - `dplyr::select()` to choose the required columns.
#    Store the returned dataset into `df`.
#    To check your solution, `df` prints to:
